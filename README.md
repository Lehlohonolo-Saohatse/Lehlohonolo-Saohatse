Hey there! I'm **Lehlohonolo Saohatse**, your friendly neighborhood code wizard 🧙‍♂️, currently leveling up as a **Computer Science and Electronics** student at **North-West University**. With a passion for breaking (and fixing) things, I’m on a mission to make an impact in the tech space (because, why not? 😎).

## 💻 Academic Background
🎓 **BSc in Computer Science & Electronics** – North-West University  
⚡ Always pushing for that extra credit, both in knowledge and experience.

## ⚡ Personal Qualities
- 🎯 Laser-focused on system design, cybersecurity, and AI.
- 🤖 A passion for innovating with technology and making things that matter.
- 🌍 Dedicated to using tech for a meaningful impact on society. (Saving the world, one line of code at a time.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
- **Languages**: Python, Java, C++, MATLAB (and always adding more)
- **Cybersecurity**: Certified in *Ethical Hacking Essentials* and *Cybersecurity for Businesses - The Fundamental Edition* by (EC-Council)
- **Cloud Computing**: Yeah, I’m in the cloud (literally) ☁️
- **Problem-Solving**: AKA debugging at 3AM 🔍
- **Teamwork**: Can collaborate like a well-tuned API.

## 🧠 Interests
- 🏗️ **System Design & Development**  
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking**  
- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence**  
- 🤝 **Collaborations**: Let’s team up and build something epic.

## 🎓 Education
- **National Senior Certificate**, South Africa  
- **BSc in Computer Science & Electronics** (Graduating 2026)

## 🔮 Future Plans
I’m always on the lookout for exciting API endpoints and opportunities to debug and deploy new tech stacks. Whether it's integrating with a new RESTful service, experimenting with GraphQL queries, or optimizing microservices architecture, I’m eager to explore and learn.

I’m open to collaborating on projects involving OAuth implementations, rate-limiting strategies, or real-time data streaming with WebSockets. If you’re keen on discussing the latest in API design, serverless architectures, or the coolest SDKs and libraries, let’s sync up and geek out together.

Let’s connect, build some robust endpoints, and see where the codebase takes us!
